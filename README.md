# Learning Haskell with Projects

Want to get into functional programming and Haskell seems like a good place to start. These are the resources I'll be going through:

1. [CIS 194 Course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/)
2. [Functional Programming Course](https://github.com/bitemyapp/fp-course)
3. [Micrograd Implementation in Pure Haskell](https://mazzo.li/posts/haskell-backprop-short.html)

I don't want to get stuck in tutorial hell, so it's nice that these "courses" are mostly articles/blogs and exercises.
